# Basic-Quiz
Simple Quiz application made in Java.
Upon loading the sight the user will be presented wih a placeholder buttons and a 'start' button. Once this is pressed the timer in the top right hand corner will being to count down from fifteen and the user will be presented with a seris of questions on the most correct pair of programming socks. Should this timer reach 0 before all four questions are answered the user will be forcefully taken to the results screen, where they get a message that they timed over and a button will change that reloads the page. Their loss however has been recored in local storage.
The quiz itself features four questions, presented as mutliple choice on buttons. If the user presses the correct button it will change to green and they may move on. If they are incorrect it change to red instead and the correct answer will be highlighted. If the user completes the questions in the time alloted they will be taken to a results screen. Their win has been recorded in the local storage.
If instead the user clicks the top left hand corner, the page will transform into a highscore screen. This page was intented to contain a list of people who completed the quiz in the alloted time and those who did not, but I ran out of time on this project.
